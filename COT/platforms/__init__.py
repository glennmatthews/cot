"""Package for identifying guest platforms and handling platform differences.

The :class:`~COT.platforms.platform.Platform` class describes the API
and provides a generic implementation that can be overridden by subclasses
to provide platform-specific logic.

In general, other modules should not access subclasses directly but should
instead use the :meth:`~COT.platforms.platform.Platform.for_product_string`
API to derive the appropriate subclass object.
